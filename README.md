# INTMAX2 Withdrawal

## Requirements
* Docker v24.0.2+;
* Docker Compose v2;
* Go v1.22+;

## Quick Start
To run and manage microservice, you can use Makefile, which contains already created commands to run, build and remove containers, also for local compilation.
* Local build: `make build-up`
* Local start:
```
(before, need copies `.env.example` as `.env`)
# make tools
# make gen
# make start-build-up
# SWAGGER_USE=true GIT_USE=true CMD_RUN="migrate --action=up" make run
# SWAGGER_USE=true GIT_USE=true CMD_RUN="run" make run
```

## Makefile command list
* `make tools`
* `make gen`
* `make build-up`
* `make up`
* `make lint`
* `make down`

## Swagger build customization with Dockerfile
```
SWAGGER_HOST_URL=127.0.0.1:8780 \
SWAGGER_BASE_PATH="\/" \
SWAGGER_USE=true \
make build-up
```
